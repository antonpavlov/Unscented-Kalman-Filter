# Unscented-Kalman-Filter
2D object tracking with the Unscented Kalman filter - Udacity's Self-Driving Car Nanodegree.

## Description ##
The covariance of the [Extended Kalman Filter](https://github.com/antonpavlov/Extended-Kalman-Filter) is propagated through linearization of the underlying non-linear model. In a vast majority of cases this technique shows a great performance. However, in case of highly non-linear <i><b>f</b></i> and <i><b>h</b></i>, the performance of the EKF deteriorates dramatically. The [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kalman_filter#Unscented_Kalman_filter) article describes the UKF as following: "<i>The unscented Kalman filter (UKF) uses a deterministic sampling technique known as the unscented transform (UT) to pick a minimal set of sample points (called sigma points) around the mean. The sigma points are then propagated through the non-linear functions, from which a new mean and covariance estimate are then formed. The resulting filter depends on how the transformed statistics of the UT are calculated and which set of sigma points are usedâ€”it should be remarked that is always possible to construct new UKFs in a consistent way. For certain systems, the resulting UKF filter more accurately estimates the true mean and covariance.</i>"

This repository contains the source code of the UKF that estimates a highly non-linear trajectory of an object.

## Requirements ##
In order to successfully build and run the program, the following requirements should be fulfilled:
* `cmake` equal or above version 3.5
* `make` equal or above version 4.1
* `gcc/g++` equal or above version 5.4
* [`uWebSocketIO`](https://github.com/uNetworking/uWebSockets) library

[Initial Udacity's repo](https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Unscented-Kalman-Filter-Project) is a good starting point for setting up an environment.

## Building and Running the code ##
In order to compile, please execute the following commands in a project folder:
* `cmake ./` - configuration of build; in case of any folder changes, you may want to delete `CMakeChache.txt`
* `make` - actual build
* `./UnscentedKF` - an execution of the program

Program opens the port 4567 (configurable in `src/main.cpp`) and waits for a connection of the simulator described in the Validation section below.

## Validation ##
Once compiled and launched, the program tries to establish a connection with a simulator. The **Term 2 Simulator** software includes a graphical simulator for the 2D object tracking by Unscented Kalman Filter. The simulator can be downloaded here: [https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

The contents of this repo were tested in Ubuntu Linux 18.04.
